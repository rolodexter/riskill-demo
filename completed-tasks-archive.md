# Riskill Demo UI Refinement - Completed Tasks Archive

## UI/UX Improvements
- Removed all content from the insights card (made it empty)
- Made right zone cards more compact and reduced padding
  - Added/adjusted CSS for right zone containers and cards as needed
- Removed highlights from anomaly and opportunity zones; highlights only apply to individual cards
- Refined lower zone cards: smaller font, more compact, scrollable on overflow (no visible scrollbars)
- Removed left trim/highlight from right side zones; only apply highlights to cards reflecting statuses, not to entire zones
- Prevented duplicate cards from being added to copilot panel when clicked multiple times
- Polished chat panel appearance for minimalism and enterprise elegance
- Enhanced card backgrounds in Anomaly and Opportunity zones with subtle, more colorful gradients (still mostly white, not too dark)
- Enhanced copilot window with rounded corners, refined gradient, and removed placeholder text for minimalist look
- Reduced height/padding in top zone for more compact appearance

## Code Cleanup
- Removed duplicate CSS for anomaly-item and opportunity-item across all relevant files
- Fixed root cause of persistent left trim/highlight: duplicate CSS definitions for anomalies/opportunities zones in index.html
- Fixed root cause of duplicate copilot cards in copilot-chat.js: openCopilotPanel() always inserted a new card reference without checking for existing ones
- Scanned all relevant files for duplicate CSS and code to prevent recurring issues

## Design Decisions
- Enterprise elegance: minimalist, subtle, professional look with a light/white color palette
- Subtle gradients and shadows to add depth without heavy colors
- Highlights only on individual cards indicating status, never on entire zones
- Compact card design with smaller fonts and optimized spacing
- Hidden scrollbars with mouse wheel scrolling enabled
- Refined copilot panel with gentle gradients and rounded corners
